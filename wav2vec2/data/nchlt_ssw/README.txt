Note:        This corpus is also referred to as nchlt-clean (see [1,2]) in order
             to contrast it with two other corpora: 
             - nchlt-raw (all utterances collected, including problematic
               utterances) and 
             - nchlt-baseline (no duplicate speakers).
             For more information see [1,2] and subsidiary resources.

DETAILED INFORMATION


DESCRIPTION:


The complete orthographically transcribed broadband speech corpora for all of 
South Africa’s eleven official languages are given i.t.o. an audio and 
transcriptions directory on a per language basis. Transcriptions are given in 
XML format and subdivided into individual train and test suites 
("nchlt_<language_code>.trn.xml" and "nchlt_<language_code>.tst.xml" respectively). 
With each XML entry in these files, additional metadata is provided (a) per speaker:
  - recording location
  - age
  - gender
and (b) per file:
  - wav file md5sum
  - wav file duration (seconds)
  - pdp_score (see [4] for more detail)

In cases where the metadata failed basic checks, e.g. invalid ID numbers, 
or was not available, the corresponding field contains the value "-1".
The majority of the speakers are in the age range between 18-55 and the ratio
between male and female speakers is close to 50:50 for each language.

Individual recordings are provided using the WAVE format (16-bit, mono,
PCM sampled at 16kHz) and is subdivided using a unique speaker identifier
(<spk_id>) for every speaker. Speaker identifiers for the test suite audio
correspond to the integer values of 500-507.
