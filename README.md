# Developing Robust ASR Systems for Nguni Languages
This repository contains the code, data splits, model configurations, and results of the fine-tuning of the models for the research Project *Developing Robust Automatic Speech Recognition Systems for South African Nguni Languages*

**Phase 2** focuses on fine-tuning two open source ASR models - Whisper and Wav2Vec2 using the pilot dataset prepared in phase 1 of the project.
