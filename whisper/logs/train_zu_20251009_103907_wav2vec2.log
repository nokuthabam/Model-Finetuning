2025-10-09 10:40:49,885 - ERROR - An error occurred during training: Weights only load failed. This file can still be loaded, to do so you have two options, [1mdo those steps only if you trust the source of the checkpoint[0m. 
	(1) In PyTorch 2.6, we changed the default value of the `weights_only` argument in `torch.load` from `False` to `True`. Re-running `torch.load` with `weights_only` set to `False` will likely succeed, but it can result in arbitrary code execution. Do it only if you got the file from a trusted source.
	(2) Alternatively, to load with `weights_only=True` please check the recommended steps in the following error message.
	WeightsUnpickler error: Unsupported global: GLOBAL numpy._core.multiarray._reconstruct was not an allowed global by default. Please use `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals([numpy._core.multiarray._reconstruct])` or the `torch.serialization.safe_globals([numpy._core.multiarray._reconstruct])` context manager to allowlist this global if you trust this class/function.

Check the documentation of torch.load to learn more about types accepted by default with weights_only https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.load.html.
